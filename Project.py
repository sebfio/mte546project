# Two Methods for natural language processing that I can see

# 1. BOW (BAg of Words) which basically treats the text as an unrelated bag of words. Key is that it knows nothing about semantics. Downside is vectors here are sparse. Words just don't repeat all that often for the most part, and 
# we use different slots for related/similar words
# 2. A better method is using vectors (AKA word vectors). Here words are classified somewhat semantically. Two conditions should be met for this representation
#  - Similar words should be close together
#  - Allow word analogies "King" - "man" + "woman" = "queen"
# Related to RNNs
# Idea is that king and woman are related closely on one axis, but king and man are associated closely on another
# Word2Vec is one of the more popular algorithms for word vectorization
# Basically BOW looks for word 0 given words -3,-2,-1,1,2,3. 
# Word2Vec looks for words -3,-2,-1,1,2,3 given word 0.

# 3. Word2Vec Models
# Gensim is one that's pretty good
# # Go here and download + unzip the Text8 Corpus: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip
# # We take only words that appear more than 150 times for doing a visualization later
# w2v_model2 = Word2Vec(Text8Corpus('~/Downloads/text8'), size=100, window=5, min_count=150, workers=4)

# Here for example it looks at the text8 dataset and extracts words that appear 150 times or more

# if we want to visualize it we use t-sne, which compresses it to 2d/3d (wahey look at me learning SYDE522 by accident)

# 4. fastText
# Facebook's implementation, also very good but much slower than the gaensim one because it looks at substrings of words
